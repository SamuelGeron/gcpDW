<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main objective of this project is to develop a full pipeline of data by extracting, transforming and loading(ETL)into a data warehouse environment considering the best practices, allowing data visualization platforms to connect and explore business questions and eventually retrieve insights of it.

### Built With
These are the main softwares used to develop this project:
* [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)
* [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)


## Data Warehouse
You may access the data warehouse in Big Query through the following link:

## New Architecture Proposal
To continuosly improve the architecture this is the latest proposal for the architecture considering GCP resources (ps:I'm currently working on the scripts)

### Calculated Columns
Some calculated columns were created in power bi in order to support the measures
